The Orpheus Proposition is a java program designed to give me experience with the java programming language.
It is typical for me to create game applications when learning a new programming language,
and Orpheus is no different.
Since 2017, this project has taught me many things about java:
* how to manage a large project by myself.
* how to build Graphic LocalUser Interfaces using Java Swing.
* how to create class hierarchies.
* how to perform serialization with both JSON and Object streams.
* how to build a peer-to-peer network application.
* as well as countless other programming strategies and techniques that will help me for my entire career.

Orpheus will never be completed. It is not meant to be a great game,
nor even a good one. 
All it aspires to is to serve as a learning tool for me,
and since learning is an ongoing process,
it will continue to grow as I do.

With that out of the way, 
you can run the program by either compile it yourself in Netbeans,
or just download the dist folder,
and either double click on the "Orpheus.jar" file,
or navigate to the dist directory in your terminal,
and type:
java -jar Orpheus.jar
