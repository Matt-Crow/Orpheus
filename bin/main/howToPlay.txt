The Orpheus Proposition is a multiplayer arena game where human players must survive multiple waves of enemies.
Each player has their own character with they can customize.
The goal of the game is to use your active abilities to fire projectiles which will deplete enemy hit points upon colliding with them.
Once a player's hit points reach 0, they "match out", and can no longer participate in the game.
If all players match out, the players lose.
However, if the players can match out all the enemies, the next wave will be summoned. Once the last wave of enemies is defeated, the players win the game!
Before the game begins, each player chooses which build they want to use;
a build is a combination of character class, active abilities, and passive abilities that define how the player functions in-game.
You can create and customize your own builds in the "customize" menu, or you can use one of the default builds I have created for you:
(*) Default Earth is a slow, but sturdy tank with good offensive and defensive abilities. (Recommended)
(*) Default Water is a sturdy wall with weak offensive abilities, but focuses on outlasting its opponents.
(*) Default Fire is a powerful bomb of damage which attempts to inflict as much damage as possible before matching out due to its weak defenses.
(*) Default Air is a rapid-fire build which focuses on speed over power or sturdiness.
