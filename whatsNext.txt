It's time to focus on other things.
In it's current state, the program works, multiplayer is just a little... iffy. Given that I knew next to nothing about socket programming when I began, and all the guides I've found have been rather basic, "iffy" is pretty good.
Am I happy with where Orpheus is? No. I'll never be happy with it, not until it's perfect, and trying to perfect it is a wormhole I don't want to get sucked into.
I'll definitely work on it more (time permitting), but I'd like to make another Java game, one less chaotic and difficult to balance than this.

I like multiplayer enough, so I'll keep it around. Maybe someday, I'll have enough experience with socket programming to make it work better.

With that said, their are many changes that I want to make next time I have a chance to work on this:
* Move to 3-D graphics?
* Plugin customization system (players create their own Java classes)
* Standard application folder stuff and logging, like what I used in ARCDHWebAutomator
* Change player and team IDs to ints or long longs
* General cleanup and reorganization
* Redo GUI
* Security manager for multiplayer
* use Socket to identify users, not IP address
* Idea: standard Orpheus workflow:
    1. receive input
    2. send message to server
    3. transmit message to host
    4. host processes message
    5. host sends back response
    6. update accordingly
    Non-multiplayer just skips the step of sending to a remote server
* will need some way of reliably shutting down servers once the program is done 
  with them
* cleaning up the World system:
    - role -  | - solo - | - host - | - client -
