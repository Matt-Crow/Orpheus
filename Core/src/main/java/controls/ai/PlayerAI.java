 * The PlayerAI class is used to control non-human-controlled
 * Players. It supports extendable behaviors, as seen in AbstractBehavior.
 * 
 * In previous versions of Orpheus, all Entities would have AI,
 * but would be turned off for everything but fake players and tracking projectiles.
 * Since tracking projectiles don't feel like they fit with the game anymore,
 * I've removed the base AI class.
